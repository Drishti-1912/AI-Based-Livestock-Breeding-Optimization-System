# AI-Based-Livestock-Breeding-Optimization-System
An AI System to  analyze livestock genetics and Recommend optimal breeding pairs to improve herd quality.

Modern animal husbandry and aquaculture technology that incorporates artificial intelligence can automatically detect the weight of various animals and stages of development; we can feed them according to our will or desire of animals and monitor the effect of feed in order to get better results. As we know, our population is increasing day by day, which is directly enhancing the need for things like eggs, meat, and milk. Researchers conclude that for smart farming we need AI in the form of robots and other tools like software that contain AI modules in them. These tools will minimise the cost of farming and also improve the quality of the product. So for these, they researched, and a smart cow house was built in which there were some sensors that sensed the activity of cows and also sensed weight and disease by using artificial intelligence. The early diagnosis and tracking system may help to diagnose disease at an early stage, which also helps to treat the disease earlier and save farmers from big losses. Recent times have seen demands for increased farm animal production.
